	// Why is my transaction shown as Pending?
// A pending transaction is an authorised payment 
//that's still awaiting confirmation from Mastercard. All newly made transactions will first be classified as pending.
// The funds will be held until Mastercard has given its confirmation of the transaction. 
// All pending transactions will be completed or reversed within 8 days.
	

// Why was my transaction reversed?
// A reversed transaction is a cancelled or declined transaction 
// because it has not been cleared successfully by Mastercard within 8 days. Not to worry,
// the full amount will be reversed back to your YouTrip account.

// However, in some rare situations,
// we may receive confirmation of pending transactions only after 8 days.
// In such cases, the original transaction will remain reversed 
// while a new transaction record with the confirmed transaction amount will be created.
